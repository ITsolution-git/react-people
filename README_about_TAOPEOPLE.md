# Taopeople

We are a start-up working in stealth. Our mission is to build a platform which that helps Businesses to find much better new talents. We believe that today you can find so many data about people in the internet, that the way how people are searched is very old-fashioned. We want to change this. The company is founded and funded bye three serial entrepreneurs with a 20 year track record in digital Business. The goal of this project is to build an minimal valuable product to gain immediate feedback from clients. The code must be state of the art as we want to rely on this code after a successful feedback loop with first clients. We start with a white sheet - there is no code at all yet but a clear view how we want to tackle this problem.
