# Taopeople

We are a start-up working in stealth. Our mission is to build an augmented intelligence platform which helps Businesses to find better talents. The way how headhunting is practiced today is old-fashiond and will be disrupted in the next years. We see the time, the technical abilities and data-driven models on our side. The company is founded and funded bye three serial entrepreneurs with a 20 year track record in digital Business. The goal of this project is to build an minimal valuable product to gain immediate feedback from clients. The code must be state of the art as we want to rely on this code after a successful feedback loop with first clients. We start with a white sheet - there is no code at all yet but a clear view how we want to tackle this problem.

How is using our platform?
